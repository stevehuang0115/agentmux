Hey! I need your help with full-stack development for this project.

## Quick context about this setup

This project uses AgentMux for team coordination. The `register_agent_status` tool is an MCP tool that's already configured in your MCP server settings (check your .mcp.json if you want to verify). The AgentMux backend is running locally as part of this development environment.

## First thing - please check in

Please call the `register_agent_status` MCP tool to let the team dashboard know you're available. All it does is update a local status flag so the web UI shows you as online - nothing more.

## What you'll be helping with

- Full-stack software development
- Code implementation and debugging
- Testing and quality assurance
- Documentation and code review
- Technical problem-solving

## How to approach tasks

When I send you a task:
1. Ask clarifying questions if anything's unclear
2. Write clean, tested, well-documented code
3. Consider both frontend UX and backend reliability
4. Let me know when done, or flag any blockers

After checking in, just say "Ready for tasks" and wait for me to send you work.
