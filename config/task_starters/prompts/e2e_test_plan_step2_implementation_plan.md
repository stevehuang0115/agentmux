E2E TEST PLAN GENERATION - STEP 2

## Task: Create Comprehensive E2E Test Implementation Plan

Based on your technology selection from Step 1, create a detailed implementation plan.

### Implementation Structure
Create the following task files in `{PROJECT_PATH}/.agentmux/tasks/m0_defining_project/open/`:

**File: `04_e2e_test_implementation_qa.md`**
Include the following sections:

## Objective
Implement comprehensive E2E testing suite using [your selected technology] for [project type]

## Technology Setup
- **Primary Framework**: [Your chosen framework and version]
- **Additional Tools**: [Page Object Model, test runners, reporting tools]
- **CI/CD Integration**: [How tests will run in pipeline]

## Test Architecture
- **Project Structure**: Test file organization
- **Page Objects/Screen Objects**: Abstraction layer for UI elements
- **Test Data Management**: How to handle test data, fixtures, mocks
- **Environment Configuration**: Dev, staging, prod test environments

## User Journey Test Cases
Map each step from the user journey to specific test scenarios:

### Test Case 1: [Primary User Flow]
- **Scenario**: [Description]
- **Steps**: [Detailed test steps]
- **Expected Results**: [What should happen]
- **Test Data**: [Required data setup]

### Test Case 2: [Secondary User Flow]
- **Scenario**: [Description]
- **Steps**: [Detailed test steps]
- **Expected Results**: [What should happen]
- **Test Data**: [Required data setup]

[Continue for all major user flows...]

## Error & Edge Case Testing
- **Network Failures**: Offline scenarios, API timeouts
- **Invalid Input Handling**: Form validation, data corruption
- **Authentication Issues**: Login failures, session expiry
- **Browser/Device Compatibility**: Cross-platform testing

## Test Execution Strategy
- **Local Development**: How developers run tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated test execution
- **Reporting**: Test results, screenshots, videos on failure
- **Maintenance**: Keeping tests updated with code changes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] E2E testing framework installed and configured
- [ ] All critical user journeys covered by automated tests
- [ ] Page object models created for UI abstraction
- [ ] Test data management system implemented
- [ ] CI/CD integration completed
- [ ] Error scenarios and edge cases tested
- [ ] Test execution and reporting pipeline working

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete test suite covers 90%+ of user journey scenarios
- [ ] Tests run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test failures provide clear, actionable feedback
- [ ] Documentation created for maintaining and extending tests
- [ ] Team trained on running and writing E2E tests

**Focus on creating tests that provide confidence in the complete user experience, not just individual components.**
