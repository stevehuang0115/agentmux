			"Feature-based milestone directories created under .crewly/tasks/",

			"5-15 feature-based milestone directories based on project complexity analysis",
			"3-8 granular task files per milestone directory (maximum 4 hours per task)",
			"Each task file includes: single-focused objective, scope boundaries, granular implementation steps, comprehensive testing plan, quality gates",
			"Task files follow enhanced template for maximum granularity and developer success",
			"Platform separation: backend, frontend, mobile, desktop, DevOps tasks in separate milestones",
			"Feature isolation: authentication, payments, dashboard, notifications in separate milestone groups",
			"Clear dependency mapping between milestones and individual tasks"

			"Tasks organized by features (authentication, payments, etc.) with platform separation",
			"Maximum task size: 4 hours total implementation time",
			"Each task has single responsibility and clear scope boundaries",
			"Comprehensive testing plan included in every single task",
			"Quality gates (build, lint, test, coverage) mandatory for every task",
			"Dependencies between tasks clearly mapped and documented",
			"Implementation steps broken into smallest possible increments",
			"Platform-specific tasks properly separated and organized"

		"notes": [
			"This workflow assumes specifications already exist in .crewly/specs/",
			"Milestone structure adapts to project features and platforms (5-15 milestones typical)",
			"Single comprehensive step combines feature analysis, directory creation, and granular task generation",
			"Tasks organized by: Feature Area > Platform > Individual Granular Tasks",
			"Verification ensures both feature-based directory structure AND granular task files are created",
			"Each task must be completable by a single developer in one focused work session",
			"Testing requirements are integrated into every task, not separate milestones"
