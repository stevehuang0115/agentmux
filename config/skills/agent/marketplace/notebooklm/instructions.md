# NotebookLM Skill

Interact with Google NotebookLM to create research notebooks, add source materials, and generate audio overviews.

## Status: Planned

This skill requires a NotebookLM MCP server to be configured before use. It is not yet fully operational.

## Setup Requirements

1. Install and configure a NotebookLM MCP server (e.g., `notebooklm-mcp`)
2. Add the MCP server to your Claude Code configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "notebooklm": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["notebooklm-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Verify the MCP server is running and accessible
