## Workflow

```
1. Generate writing brief     → execute.sh '{"action":"draft",...}'
2. Write content using brief  → Agent uses LLM to write
3. Save completed draft       → execute.sh '{"action":"save",...}'
4. Add to content calendar    → content-calendar skill
5. Steve reviews + publishes  → Manual
```

## Platform Writing Tips

### X Thread Best Practices
- Hook tweet is everything — if they don't stop scrolling, nothing else matters
- Each tweet = one idea, one screenshot, or one data point
- Use numbers: "3 things I learned" > "Things I learned"
- End with a thread-pull: "If this was useful, follow me for more"
- Steve's top performers on Xiaohongshu all had strong visual hooks — apply same principle

### LinkedIn Best Practices
- First line shows in feed preview — make it impossible to not click "see more"
- "I" stories outperform "You should" advice
- Specific > general: "We saved 47 hours/week" > "We saved a lot of time"
- Post between 8-10am EST Tuesday-Thursday for max reach

### Xiaohongshu Best Practices (from Steve's data)
- Video outperforms image-text (20 videos vs 12 image-text in Steve's archive)
- Top tags to use: 创业MVP, 职场smalltalk, 用好ai拿捏职场, vibecoding
- Steve's top post (201 likes): "Claude Code牛马工厂" — visual + relatable + specific tool
- Social/community posts (Google coffee chat: 164 likes) also perform well
- Include 8+ hashtags for discovery

### Substack Best Practices
- Subject line = open rate. Test: numbers, questions, or contrarian takes
- Personal stories in the opening paragraph build connection
- Include 1 actionable takeaway readers can use this week
- Cross-promote: mention X thread, YouTube video in each issue

## Brand Voice Quick Reference

### Crewly Brand
- **Do:** Use specific metrics, show product screenshots, reference real use cases
- **Don't:** Claim "revolutionary" or "game-changing", oversell features not yet built
- **Signature phrases:** "AI Team", "Ready in Days", "Quality Gates", "Live Terminal"

### Steve Personal
- **Do:** Share real numbers, mention Google/side projects, be vulnerable about failures
- **Don't:** Lecture, be preachy, use generic "hustle" motivation
- **Signature phrases:** "一人公司", "下班2小时", "留在牌桌上", "Build in Public"
