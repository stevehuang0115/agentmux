# Competitor Content Tracker

Track and compare competitor content activity using browser automation and web search. Store structured data for trend analysis and content strategy.

## Architecture

1. **Browser scanning** (agent-driven) — Visit competitor pages, extract content data

## Recommended Scan Schedule

| Frequency | What to Scan |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Daily** | CrewAI Twitter, n8n Twitter — quick check for announcements |
| **Twice/week** | CrewAI blog, n8n community, Relevance AI changelog |
| **Weekly** | GitHub releases (all competitors), full comparison report |
| **Ad-hoc** | When WebSearch reveals breaking news (acquisitions, security events, major launches) |

## Workflow Integration

```
1. Agent scans competitor pages via browser/WebSearch
2. Agent saves structured data via execute.sh save
3. Agent runs compare to see cross-competitor activity
4. Agent identifies content opportunities (reactive or counter-narrative)
5. Agent feeds opportunities to trend-monitor suggest or content-writer draft
```
