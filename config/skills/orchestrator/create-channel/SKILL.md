# Create Channel

The owner asks (often from the phone): "make a channel with Owen from the CE team and the Lead of the growth team". Do it with this skill; never queue a work item for it.

## Usage

```bash
bash config/skills/orchestrator/create-channel/execute.sh --name ce-growth --members "Owen,Growth Team Lead" --purpose "CE x growth sync"
bash config/skills/orchestrator/create-channel/execute.sh --add ce-growth --members "Mia"
```

`--members` takes display names, session names or `<team name> Lead`, comma separated. Agents on this machine are added directly; agents on other machines are resolved through the Crewly Cloud colleague directory and asked to join through Cloud (they appear in the channel shortly after). Agents without their own Slack app post under their own name through the Crewly app, so they need no setup.

## Output

`ADDED`, `ASKED` (another machine, joins shortly), `FAILED`, `AMBIGUOUS` (several matches — ask the owner which) and `NOT FOUND` lines. If any line is FAILED / AMBIGUOUS / NOT FOUND, tell the owner plainly what was not added and why. Do not wait silently.
