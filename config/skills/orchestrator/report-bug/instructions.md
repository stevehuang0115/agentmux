# Report Bug

Submit a bug report either as a GitHub Issue (if `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated) or as a local markdown file in `~/.crewly/bug-reports/`.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Default                     | Description                          |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `title`   | string | (required)                  | Bug report title                     |
| `body`    | string | (required)                  | Full bug report body (markdown)      |
| `labels`  | string | `self-evolution,auto-triage`| Comma-separated GitHub issue labels  |
| `repo`    | string | (current repo)              | GitHub repo in `owner/repo` format   |

## Usage

```bash
# Submit a bug report
bash config/skills/orchestrator/report-bug/execute.sh '{"title":"Agent crashes on startup","body":"## Description\nAgent dev1 crashes...\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start agent\n2. Observe crash\n\n## Evidence\n[log excerpts]","labels":"self-evolution,auto-triage"}'
```

## Behavior

1. **If `gh` CLI is available and authenticated:** Creates a GitHub Issue with the given title, body, and labels
2. **If `gh` is not available:** Saves the report as a markdown file at `~/.crewly/bug-reports/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-title.md`

## When to Use

- After completing self-evolution triage and identifying a real bug
- Only submit after getting user approval (ask before running this skill)
- Include evidence: log excerpts, timestamps, session names, error messages
