# O3-KR4: Write API Reference Documentation

Getting Started guide is done — nice work! Now create the API Reference to complete the docs story for open-source launch.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** the backend routes to understand all API endpoints:
   - `backend/src/routes/` directory — scan all route files
   - `backend/src/controllers/` — understand request/response shapes
   - Check existing types in `backend/src/types/`
2. **Create** `docs/api-reference.md` with:
   - **Overview**: Base URL, authentication, response format
   - **Teams API**: CRUD operations for teams and members
   - **Projects API**: CRUD for projects, team assignments
   - **Sessions API**: Start/stop/write/read agent sessions
   - **Agents API**: Status, logs, heartbeat
   - **Memory API**: Remember, recall, knowledge CRUD
   - **Task Management API**: Assign, complete, list tasks
   - **Events API**: Subscribe/unsubscribe, scheduled checks
   - **Slack API**: Send messages, upload images
   - For each endpoint: HTTP method, path, request body (with types), response body (with example), error codes
3. Verify all endpoints against actual route files — no guessing
4. Include curl examples for the most common operations

After completing, report status.
