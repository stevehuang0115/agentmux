# O1-KR1: Competitive Gap Analysis — Crewly vs OpenClaw/CrewAI/AutoGen

Produce a detailed feature comparison matrix. Research these competitors:
- **OpenClaw** (formerly OpenHands) — ~68k GitHub stars
- **CrewAI** — ~57k GitHub stars, Python SDK
- **AutoGen** (Microsoft) — ~55k GitHub stars
- **LangGraph** — 4.2M monthly downloads

For each, analyze:
1. **Core Architecture** — how agents are orchestrated, what runtimes they support
2. **Key Features** — what capabilities they offer (multi-agent, tool use, memory, planning, etc.)
3. **Developer Experience** — onboarding, CLI, docs quality, time-to-first-agent
4. **Community & Ecosystem** — GitHub activity, Discord/community size, integrations, marketplace
5. **Gaps** — what Crewly is MISSING compared to each competitor
6. **Crewly Advantages** — what we do BETTER (runtime-agnostic CLI, PTY sessions, etc.)

Output: A markdown document saved to the project at `.crewly/docs/competitive-gap-matrix.md` with a clear comparison table and a prioritized list of gaps to close.

Use web search to get the latest data. This analysis will drive the roadmap (O1-KR2).

After completing, report status.
