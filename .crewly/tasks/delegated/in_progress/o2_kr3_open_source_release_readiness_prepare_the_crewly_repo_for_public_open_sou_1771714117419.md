# O2-KR3: Open Source Release Readiness

Prepare the Crewly repo for public open-source release. Specifically:

1. **LICENSE file** — Add an MIT LICENSE file to the repo root if one doesn't exist already
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Review the existing CONTRIBUTING.md (if present) and ensure it has: how to set up dev environment, how to run tests, how to submit PRs, code standards summary
3. **README.md** — Review and improve: clear project description, installation instructions (npx crewly onboard), quick start guide, feature list, screenshots/demo section placeholder, badges (build status, npm version, license)
4. **package.json** — Ensure metadata is complete: description, keywords, repository, license field, homepage

This is about making the repo look professional and welcoming for external contributors. Focus on accuracy — don't add links or badges that don't work yet.

After completing, run `npm run build` to verify nothing is broken, then report status.
