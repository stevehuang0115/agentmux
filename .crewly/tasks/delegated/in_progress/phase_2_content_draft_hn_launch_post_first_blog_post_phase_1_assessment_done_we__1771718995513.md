# Phase 2 Content: Draft HN Launch Post + First Blog Post

Phase 1 assessment done — we're at the trigger point. Two blockers (LICENSE + uncommitted files) are on Sam. Let's get Phase 2 content ready so we can launch as soon as Sam finishes.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** `.crewly/docs/phase2-launch-plan.md` and `.crewly/docs/competitive-gap-matrix.md` for context
2. **Draft HN Show Post** at `.crewly/docs/launch-hn-post.md`:
   - Title: 'Show HN: Crewly – Open-source multi-agent orchestration for AI coding teams'
   - Body: What it does, why we built it, key differentiators vs CrewAI/AutoGen/OpenHands, quick demo flow, link to repo
   - Keep it authentic HN style — technical, honest, no marketing fluff
   - Under 300 words
3. **Draft First Blog Post** at `docs/blog/01-introducing-crewly.md`:
   - Title: 'Introducing Crewly: Orchestrate AI Coding Teams from Your Terminal'
   - Sections: Problem, Solution, How It Works, Getting Started, What's Next
   - Target: 800-1200 words, developer audience
   - Include code snippets showing CLI usage
4. Both drafts should be ready for final review — not just outlines

After completing, report status.
