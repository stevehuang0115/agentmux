# O2-KR3 / O3-KR4: Write Getting Started Guide

Both O1-KR1 (gap matrix) and O1-KR2 (roadmap v3) are complete — great work! Now let's work on developer documentation which is critical for open source launch.

Create a comprehensive Getting Started guide for new Crewly users.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** the existing README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and `.crewly/docs/roadmap-v3.md` to understand current state
2. **Create** `docs/getting-started.md` with:
   - **Prerequisites**: Node.js 20+, npm, Claude API key (or other LLM keys)
   - **Installation**: `npm install -g crewly` and `npx crewly onboard`
   - **Quick Start** (5-minute walkthrough):
     a. Install Crewly
     b. Run `crewly onboard` — pick a team template
     c. Start Crewly (`crewly start`)
     d. Open the dashboard
     e. See your agents working
   - **Core Concepts**: Teams, Agents, Roles, Skills, Projects, Orchestrator
   - **Common Tasks**: Create a team, assign a task, check agent status, use the chat
   - **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and fixes
3. Keep it practical with code examples and screenshots placeholders
4. Target audience: developers who know CLI tools but haven't used multi-agent systems

After completing, report status.
