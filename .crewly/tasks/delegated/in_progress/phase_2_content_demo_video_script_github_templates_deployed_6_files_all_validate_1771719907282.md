# Phase 2 Content: Demo Video Script

GitHub templates deployed — 6 files, all validated! The launch content suite is now:
✅ HN post, ✅ Blog, ✅ Social media, ✅ Discord guide, ✅ GitHub templates (deployed)

Next key asset: a demo video script. This will be used for the YouTube demo and can also serve as a live demo guide.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** the Getting Started guide (`docs/getting-started.md`) and example projects (`examples/`) for accuracy
2. **Create** `.crewly/docs/demo-video-script.md` with:
   - **Duration**: Target 3-5 minutes
   - **Format**: Scene-by-scene script with:
     - What's on screen (terminal commands, dashboard views)
     - Voiceover narration text
     - Timing for each scene
   - **Story arc**:
     a. Hook (15s): The problem — managing multiple AI agents is chaos
     b. Install (30s): `npx crewly onboard` → pick template → done
     c. Start (30s): `crewly start` → dashboard opens → agents appear
     d. Work (90s): Show agents actually working on a task together — delegate via chat, watch real-time progress
     e. Features (60s): Quick montage — memory, skills marketplace, multi-runtime, MCP
     f. CTA (15s): GitHub link, star the repo, join Discord
   - Include exact CLI commands and expected outputs
   - Note which parts need screen recording vs. animated graphics

After completing, report status.
