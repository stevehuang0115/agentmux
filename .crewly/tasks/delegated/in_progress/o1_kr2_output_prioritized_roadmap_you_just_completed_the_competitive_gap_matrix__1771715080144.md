# O1-KR2: Output Prioritized Roadmap

You just completed the competitive gap matrix (v3.0 at .crewly/docs/competitive-gap-matrix.md) and roadmap-v2.md. Now refine and finalize the prioritized roadmap based on the gap analysis.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** the existing `.crewly/docs/competitive-gap-matrix.md` and `.crewly/docs/roadmap-v2.md` to understand current state
2. **Update or create** `.crewly/docs/roadmap-v3.md` with:
   - Prioritized feature list (P0/P1/P2) based on competitive gaps
   - Each item should have: feature name, description, why it matters (which competitor gap it closes), estimated complexity (S/M/L), dependencies
   - Group by theme: Core Platform, Developer Experience, Ecosystem, Community
   - Phase 1 (now): features Sam can start building immediately
   - Phase 2 (after core ready): marketing/growth features
   - Phase 3 (with users): community/support features
3. **Align with the OKR** — ensure roadmap items map to OKR key results

This roadmap will be the direct input for Sam's daily feature work (O2-KR1). Make it actionable — Sam should be able to pick the top item and start coding.

After completing, report status.
