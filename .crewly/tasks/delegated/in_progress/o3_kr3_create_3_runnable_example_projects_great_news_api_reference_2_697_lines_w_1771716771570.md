# O3-KR3: Create 3 Runnable Example Projects

Great news — API Reference (2,697 lines) was saved before your session suspended. Moving on to the next deliverable.

Sam created 3 team templates (web-dev, research, startup) at `config/templates/`. Now we need 3 matching example projects that users can clone and run immediately as demos.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** `config/templates/*.json` to understand the 3 team templates
2. **Create** `examples/` directory with 3 example projects:

   a. **`examples/web-app/`** — matches web-dev-team template
      - `README.md`: What this example does, how to run it
      - `.crewly/config.json`: Pre-configured team using web-dev template
      - Simple project structure (e.g. a basic Express + React todo app skeleton)
      - Instructions: `cd examples/web-app && crewly start`

   b. **`examples/research-project/`** — matches research-team template
      - `README.md`: Research project example
      - `.crewly/config.json`: Pre-configured research team
      - Sample research brief/topic for agents to work on

   c. **`examples/startup-mvp/`** — matches startup-team template
      - `README.md`: MVP prototyping example
      - `.crewly/config.json`: Pre-configured startup team
      - Simple product spec for agents to build

3. Each example should be self-contained and runnable with just `crewly start`
4. Add an `examples/README.md` index linking to all 3

After completing, report status.
