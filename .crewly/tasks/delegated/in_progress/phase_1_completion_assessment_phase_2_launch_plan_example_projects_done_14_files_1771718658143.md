# Phase 1 Completion Assessment + Phase 2 Launch Plan

Example projects done (14 files, 3 projects). Let's step back and assess Phase 1 completion.

The Phase 1→2 trigger from the OKR is: '3+ 差异化核心功能 + 完整 demo flow + 用户确认'

Deliverables:
1. **Phase 1 Audit** — Review everything completed so far and assess against the OKR:
   - O1-KR1: Competitive gap matrix ✅
   - O1-KR2: Roadmap v3 ✅
   - O2-KR1: Features built (F5 templates, F6 adapter, F7 MCP client)
   - O2-KR3: Open source prep (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, docs)
   - Documentation: Getting Started, API Reference
   - Example projects: 3 runnable demos
   Write a summary at `.crewly/docs/phase1-assessment.md`

2. **Gap Check** — What's still missing before we can say Phase 1 is done?
   - Is the demo flow complete end-to-end? Can a new user actually run `npx crewly onboard` → pick template → `crewly start` → see agents working?
   - Are there any critical bugs or rough edges?
   - What about O2-KR2 (code quality)? Sam is working on this now.

3. **Phase 2 Launch Plan** — Draft the GTM (go-to-market) plan:
   - What needs to happen before first public launch (HN/Product Hunt/etc.)?
   - Content calendar: blog posts, demo video, social media
   - Community setup: Discord, GitHub Discussions
   - Timeline estimate
   Write to `.crewly/docs/phase2-launch-plan.md`

After completing, report status.
