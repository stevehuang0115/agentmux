# O2-KR1: Build Demo Team Templates (Roadmap F5, P0)

Mia completed the prioritized roadmap at `.crewly/docs/roadmap-v3.md`. Your Sprint Board top items F1-F4 (LICENSE, README, crewly onboard) are already done from previous work. The next P0 item is F5: Demo Team Templates.

Create 3 pre-built team templates that new users can instantly deploy with `crewly onboard`. These serve as onboarding hooks — users pick a template and have a working multi-agent team in minutes.

Deliverables:
1. **Read** `.crewly/docs/roadmap-v3.md` to understand F5 requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Create 3 team templates** (likely as JSON config files in a templates directory):
   - **Web Dev Team**: Frontend dev + Backend dev + QA tester — for building web apps
   - **Research Team**: Researcher + Analyst + Writer — for research and content creation
   - **Startup Team**: Product Manager + Developer + Generalist — for rapid prototyping
3. Each template should include: team name, description, member roles, system prompts, suggested skills
4. Templates should be usable by the `crewly onboard` flow — check how `cli/src/commands/onboard.ts` works and integrate
5. Run `npm run build:backend && npm run build:cli` to verify

After completing, report status.
