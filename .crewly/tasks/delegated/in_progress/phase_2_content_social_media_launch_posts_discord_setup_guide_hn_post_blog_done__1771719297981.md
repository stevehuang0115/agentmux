# Phase 2 Content: Social Media Launch Posts + Discord Setup Guide

HN post + blog done — great work! Now prepare the rest of the launch content.

Deliverables:
1. **Social Media Launch Posts** at `.crewly/docs/launch-social-posts.md`:
   - **Twitter/X thread** (5-7 tweets): Launch announcement, what it does, key features, demo GIF placeholder, CTA to GitHub
   - **Reddit post** for r/programming and r/artificial: Similar to HN but adapted for Reddit culture
   - **LinkedIn post**: More professional tone, emphasize team productivity angle
   - Each post should be copy-pasteable with character counts

2. **Discord Community Setup Guide** at `.crewly/docs/discord-setup-guide.md`:
   - Server name, description, icon suggestion
   - Channel structure (from Phase 2 plan: 7 channels)
   - Welcome message template
   - Channel descriptions and purposes
   - Bot recommendations (GitHub notifications, etc.)
   - Moderation rules
   - First-week engagement plan (what to post, when)

3. **GitHub Templates** at `.crewly/docs/github-templates.md`:
   - Issue templates: bug report, feature request, question
   - PR template
   - Discussion categories
   - These should be ready to copy into .github/ directory

After completing, report status.
