## 1) Blog Post Outlines (3)

### Blog 1: Autonomy vs Control in Agent Systems (How to Choose in 2026)

- Objective: Capture solution-aware traffic evaluating agent frameworks.
- Target reader: Engineering lead / AI platform owner.
- Core thesis: Teams should choose architecture by required control boundary, not framework popularity.
- Outline:
1. Why this decision is now core GTM and product risk.
2. Competitor pattern: CrewAI frames "Crews" vs "Flows".
3. Competitor pattern: AutoGen layered APIs for abstraction choice.
4. Competitor pattern: OpenClaw balances wizard speed + gateway control plane.
5. Decision matrix (workload type, compliance, team size, incident tolerance).
6. Crewly POV: ship fast without losing runtime governance.
7. CTA: download Crewly decision checklist.
- Evidence references:
  - Evidence Pack §4 "Dual-track messaging: builder speed + production control".
  - Evidence Pack §2 (CrewAI Crews/Flows claim).
  - Evidence Pack §3 (AutoGen layered architecture claim).
  - Evidence Pack §1 (OpenClaw wizard + control plane claims).
- Confidence: High

### Blog 2: Channel-First Agent Operations (Deploy Where Teams Already Work)

- Objective: Win consideration from operations and automation buyers.
- Target reader: Ops leader / RevOps / IT automation manager.
- Core thesis: Channel ubiquity is now the adoption moat; forcing new UX hurts activation.
- Outline:
1. Why channel mismatch kills pilot-to-production conversion.
2. OpenClaw example: broad channel coverage and channel docs depth.
3. Messaging gap in market: multi-agent orchestration often ignores frontline channels.
4. Crewly playbook: channel rollout sequence (pilot, guardrails, escalation, measurement).
5. Governance checklist: identity, permissions, routing, failover.
6. CTA: request Crewly channel-readiness worksheet.
- Evidence references:
  - Evidence Pack §1 (OpenClaw multi-channel coverage claim).
  - Evidence Pack §4 "Multi-channel / multi-surface ubiquity".
  - Evidence Pack §6 Angle 2.
- Confidence: High

### Blog 3: From README to Production in 7 Days (A Practical Team Plan)

- Objective: Convert docs-driven evaluators into implementation trials.
- Target reader: Builder teams moving from POC to production.
- Core thesis: Competitors win top-of-funnel via docs; Crewly should win by shortening production path.
- Outline:
1. Day 0: architecture and ownership decisions.
2. Days 1-2: quickstart and first workflow.
3. Days 3-4: observability, failure handling, runbook basics.
4. Days 5-6: security and policy controls.
5. Day 7: launch criteria and KPI handoff.
6. Crewly template pack (runbook + KPI sheet + role checklist).
7. CTA: start 7-day Crewly implementation sprint.
- Evidence references:
  - Evidence Pack §4 "Docs-led conversion".
  - Evidence Pack §2 (CrewAI enterprise and production language).
  - Evidence Pack §3 (AutoGen docs structure + Studio onboarding signal).
- Confidence: High

## 2) Social Posts (7)

Format: ready-to-post drafts (X/LinkedIn style)

1. Post: "The agent stack decision is no longer about hype. It is autonomy vs control. The winning teams design for both from day one."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §4 dual-track messaging, §2 CrewAI Crews/Flows, §3 AutoGen layered APIs.
- Confidence: High

2. Post: "If your AI assistant only works in one UI, adoption stalls. Channel-first deployment is becoming table stakes."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §1 OpenClaw multi-channel evidence, §4 multi-surface pattern.
- Confidence: High

3. Post: "Docs are now distribution. README + clear quickstart still drive serious AI framework adoption."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §4 docs-led conversion, §2/§3 official docs surfaces.
- Confidence: High

4. Post: "Enterprise buyers ask 3 things first: security, observability, integration. If your message starts elsewhere, you lose late-stage deals."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §2 CrewAI AMP enterprise positioning, §4 enterprise trust overlay.
- Confidence: Medium-High

5. Post: "Open-source traction is a GTM signal, not just a vanity metric. Track stars, forks, issue velocity, and release cadence together."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §5 traction table and API snapshot.
- Confidence: High

6. Post: "No-code surfaces are not anti-developer. They reduce evaluation friction while engineering teams keep control deeper in the stack."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §3 AutoGen Studio claim, §4 dual-track pattern.
- Confidence: Medium-High

7. Post: "Week-1 execution model for agent products: 1) decision guide, 2) channel playbook, 3) 7-day production plan."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §6 Angles 1-3.
- Confidence: High

## 3) Landing Page Messaging Variant (1)

### Variant Name
Control Without Slowdown

### Hero
- Headline: Build Autonomous Agent Workflows Without Losing Production Control
- Subheadline: Crewly helps teams launch quickly, run across real work channels, and operate with enterprise-grade reliability.
- Primary CTA: Start the 7-Day Crewly Sprint
- Secondary CTA: View Architecture Decision Guide

### Proof Bar (social/market context)
- "Market leaders win with dual-track messaging: builder speed + control plane rigor."
- "Channel-native deployment is now expected for team adoption."
- "Docs-first acquisition still dominates early evaluation."

### Key Value Blocks
1. Launch Fast
- "From quickstart to first workflow in days, not quarters."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §4 docs-led conversion; §6 angle 3.
- Confidence: High

2. Operate Anywhere Teams Work
- "Deploy workflows into the channels teams already use."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §1 OpenClaw channel evidence; §4 multi-channel pattern.
- Confidence: High

3. Control at Production Depth
- "Add governance, observability, and reliability without sacrificing iteration speed."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §2 enterprise-readiness language; §4 enterprise trust overlay.
- Confidence: Medium-High

### Objection Handling Strip
- "Need flexibility? Keep autonomy where useful, enforce control where required."
- "Need trust? Align security and operational visibility before scale."
- Evidence references: Evidence Pack §4 dual-track + enterprise trust patterns.
- Confidence: Medium-High
