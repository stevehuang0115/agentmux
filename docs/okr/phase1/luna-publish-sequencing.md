## Execution Notes (Immediate)

- Keep all CTAs UTM-tagged by day/channel for attribution sanity (`utm_campaign=luna_week1_publish`).
- Repurpose each blog intro paragraph as a same-day short post to reduce production lag.
- Use one KPI owner per day and log outcomes in a simple daily scorecard by 18:00 local time.
