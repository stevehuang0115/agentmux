# Getting Started with Crewly

> Set up your first AI agent team in under 5 minutes.

Crewly is an open-source platform that coordinates AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex) to work together as a team. You get a real-time web dashboard to watch agents work, assign tasks, and manage projects -- all running locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Node.js v20+** and **npm v9+**
  ```bash
  # Check your versions
  node --version   # Should print v20.x or higher
  npm --version    # Should print 9.x or higher
  ```

- **At least one AI coding CLI** installed and authenticated:

  | Runtime | Install Command | Verify | Auth |
  |---------|----------------|--------|------|
  | **Claude Code** (recommended) | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `claude --version` | Run `claude` once to authenticate |
  | **Gemini CLI** | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` | `gemini --version` | Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` env variable |
  | **Codex (OpenAI)** | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | `codex --version` | Set OpenAI API key |

  > Claude Code is the default runtime. If you don't have a preference, start with Claude Code.

### Optional

- **tmux** -- Crewly uses tmux for agent session management. It's usually pre-installed on macOS and Linux. Check with `tmux -V`.
- **Slack app** -- For two-way Slack notifications. See [Configuration](#configuration) for setup.

---

## Installation

### Option A: Try instantly (no global install)

```bash
npx crewly onboard
```

This downloads Crewly temporarily and runs the setup wizard.

### Option B: Install globally (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g crewly
crewly onboard
```

The `onboard` command walks you through a 4-step setup:

1. **Choose your AI provider** -- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or both
2. **Install tools** -- Crewly checks if your chosen CLI is installed and offers to install it
3. **Install agent skills** -- Downloads the skill pack that agents use to communicate, report status, and manage tasks
4. **Done** -- You're ready to start

```
$ crewly onboard

Welcome to Crewly! Let's get you set up.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Crewly

Navigate to any project directory and start Crewly:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
crewly start
```

This does three things:
1. Starts the backend server on port `8787`
2. Sets up the orchestrator agent in the background
3. Opens the web dashboard in your browser

```
$ crewly start

🚀 Starting Crewly...
✓ Backend server running on port 8787
✓ Orchestrator session initialized
✓ Dashboard: http://localhost:8787

Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

> Use `crewly start --no-browser` to skip opening the browser automatically.

### Step 2: Create a Team

In the dashboard, click **Teams** in the sidebar, then **Create Team**.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of Teams page with Create Team button -->

Fill in:
- **Team name**: e.g., "My Dev Team"
- **Description**: optional

Then **Add Members** to the team:

| Field | Example | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Name | "Sam" | Display name for this agent |
| Role | "developer" | Determines the agent's prompt and behavior |

Available roles include: `developer`, `qa`, `frontend-developer`, `backend-developer`, `fullstack-dev`, `architect`, `designer`, `product-manager`, `generalist`, and more.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of Add Member modal -->

### Step 3: Create a Project

Click **Projects** in the sidebar, then **Create Project**.

- **Project name**: e.g., "My App"
- **Path**: the absolute path to your project directory (e.g., `/Users/you/my-project`)

### Step 4: Assign Team to Project

Open your project and assign your team. This connects agents to the codebase they'll work on.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of project detail with team assignment -->

### Step 5: Start Your Agents

Once a team is assigned to a project, click **Start** on a team member. Crewly launches the agent's CLI in its own terminal session.

You can now:
- **Watch the live terminal** -- see exactly what each agent is doing in real time
- **Send input** -- type into an agent's terminal to guide it
- **View the activity feed** -- see status updates, task completions, and agent communications

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of live terminal streaming -->

That's it! Your agents are working. The orchestrator automatically coordinates tasks, and agents use their skills to report progress and collaborate.

## Core Concepts

### Teams

A **team** is a group of AI agents that work together. Each team has:
- A name and description
- One or more **members** (agents with assigned roles)
- An optional **orchestrator** that coordinates the team

Teams are stored in `~/.crewly/teams.json`.

### Agents

An **agent** is an AI coding assistant running in its own terminal session. Each agent has:
- A **role** (developer, QA, PM, etc.) that shapes its behavior via a system prompt
- A **runtime** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Codex) that determines which AI model powers it
- A **session** (a tmux terminal) where it executes commands
- Access to **skills** (bash scripts for communication and coordination)
- **Memory** that persists across sessions

Agent statuses: `inactive` → `starting` → `active` → `suspended`

### Roles

A **role** defines what an agent does. Roles come with pre-written system prompts that instruct the agent on its responsibilities. Crewly includes 14 built-in roles:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `developer` | General software development |
| `frontend-developer` | Frontend/UI development |
| `backend-developer` | Backend/API development |
| `fullstack-dev` | End-to-end development |
| `architect` | System architecture and technical design |
| `qa` / `qa-engineer` | Quality assurance and testing |
| `designer` | Design work |
| `product-manager` | Product management and planning |
| `generalist` | General-purpose tasks |
| `orchestrator` | Coordinates other agents (auto-created) |
| `tpm` | Technical program management |
| `sales` | Sales and customer engagement |
| `support` | Customer support |

Role prompts live in `config/roles/<role>/prompt.md`.

### Skills

**Skills** are bash scripts that agents call to perform actions. They're the communication backbone of Crewly. Examples:

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `report-status` | Tell the orchestrator "I'm done" or "I'm blocked" |
| `accept-task` | Accept a task assignment |
| `complete-task` | Mark a task as finished |
| `recall` | Search agent memory for relevant context |
| `remember` | Store knowledge for future sessions |
| `get-team-status` | Check what other agents are working on |
| `check-quality-gates` | Run build/test/lint checks before completing |
| `query-knowledge` | Search the knowledge base for docs and SOPs |
| `heartbeat` | Send a "still alive" signal to the backend |

Skills live in `config/skills/agent/`. Each skill has an `execute.sh` script, `skill.json` metadata, and `instructions.md` documentation.

Install skills with:
```bash
crewly install --all
```

### Projects

A **project** maps to a directory on your machine. When you assign a team to a project, agents get context about the codebase and work within that directory. Projects track:
- Tasks (open, in-progress, done, blocked)
- Progress metrics
- Associated team

Project data lives in `~/.crewly/projects.json`.

### Orchestrator

The **orchestrator** is a special agent (`crewly-orc`) that automatically starts when you run `crewly start`. It:
- Coordinates work across team members
- Delegates tasks to the right agent based on role and availability
- Monitors agent health via heartbeats
- Manages the task queue

You can chat with the orchestrator directly through the **Chat** page in the dashboard.

### Memory

Agents have persistent memory that survives across sessions:

- **Agent memory** -- personal knowledge specific to one agent (stored with `remember` skill)
- **Project memory** -- shared knowledge available to all agents on a project (stored with `scope: project`)
- **Knowledge base** -- markdown documents with YAML frontmatter, searchable via `query-knowledge`

Memory is stored in the filesystem:
- Global: `~/.crewly/`
- Per-project: `<project-path>/.crewly/`

---

## Common Tasks

### Create a Team via Dashboard

1. Open `http://localhost:8787`
2. Navigate to **Teams** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create Team**
4. Add a name and description
5. Click **Add Member** for each agent:
   - Set a name, choose a role, select a runtime
6. Save the team

### Assign a Task

Tasks can be assigned through the dashboard:
1. Go to **Projects** → select your project
2. Create a new task with a title and description
3. Assign it to a team member
4. The agent picks it up and starts working

Or chat with the orchestrator:
1. Go to **Chat**
2. Type a request like: "Build a login page for the app"
3. The orchestrator delegates to the appropriate agent

### Check Agent Status

**From the dashboard**:
- The **Teams** page shows each agent's status (active, idle, working)
- Click an agent to see their live terminal output

**From the CLI**:
```bash
crewly status
```
```
Crewly Status:
  Backend: running (port 8787)
  Sessions: 3 active
    crewly-orc (orchestrator) - active
    dev-1 (developer) - active
    qa-1 (qa) - active
```

### View Logs

```bash
# View recent logs
crewly logs

# Follow logs in real time
crewly logs -f

# Show more lines
crewly logs -n 200
```

### Stop Crewly

```bash
# Graceful shutdown
crewly stop

# Force kill if something is stuck
crewly stop --force
```

### Install Marketplace Skills

```bash
# Search for skills
crewly search image

# Install a specific skill
crewly install skill-nano-banana

# Install all agent skills
crewly install --all
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root or set these in your shell:

```bash
# AI Provider Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here           # Required for Gemini CLI runtime

# Slack Integration (optional)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...

# Server Settings
WEB_PORT=8787                          # Dashboard port (default: 8787)
LOG_LEVEL=info                         # debug, info, warn, error
```

### Global Config

Crewly stores global configuration in `~/.crewly/`:

```
~/.crewly/
├── config.env          # Port, intervals, global settings
├── teams.json          # Team definitions
├── projects.json       # Project definitions
├── docs/               # Knowledge base documents
├── skills/             # Installed marketplace skills
└── memory/             # Agent memory storage
```

### Per-Project Config

Each project can have its own `.crewly/` directory:

```
my-project/
├── .crewly/
│   ├── docs/           # Project-specific knowledge docs
│   └── memory/         # Project-scoped agent memories
├── src/
└── package.json
```

### Agent Runtimes

You can configure which runtime each agent uses in the dashboard Settings, or when adding team members:

| Runtime | Default Command | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Claude Code | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | Default. No API key needed (uses Claude auth). |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini --yolo` | Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `codex --full-auto` | Requires OpenAI API key |

You can mix runtimes within a team -- e.g., orchestrator on Claude, developer on Gemini.

  crewly search "image"           # Find image-related skills
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Port 8787 is already in use"

Another process is using the default port. Either stop it or use a different port:

```bash
# Option 1: Stop the existing Crewly instance
crewly stop

# Option 2: Use a different port
crewly start -p 9090
```

### "No agent skills installed"

You'll see a warning on startup if skills aren't installed. Fix it:

```bash
crewly install --all
```

Or re-run the setup wizard:

```bash
crewly onboard
```

### Agents Show as "Inactive"

Agents need to be started manually after creating a team. In the dashboard:
1. Go to **Teams**
2. Click on your team
3. Click **Start** next to each agent

If an agent keeps going inactive, check:
- Is the AI CLI installed? (`claude --version`, `gemini --version`)
- Is the API key set? (check `.env` or environment variables)
- Check the logs: `crewly logs -f`

### Dashboard Won't Open

```bash
# Check if the server is actually running
crewly status

# If running but browser didn't open, go manually to:
# http://localhost:8787

# If not running, check for port conflicts
crewly start --no-browser
```

### "tmux not found"

Install tmux:

```bash
# macOS
brew install tmux

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tmux

# Fedora
sudo dnf install tmux
```

### Agent Appears Stuck

If an agent seems unresponsive:

1. Check the live terminal in the dashboard -- the agent may be waiting for input
2. Try sending input through the terminal interface
3. Crewly has auto-continuation built in -- it detects stuck states and auto-resumes with configurable max iterations
4. As a last resort, stop and restart the agent from the dashboard

### Build Errors on Installation

If `npm install -g crewly` fails with native module errors (usually `node-pty`):

```bash
# macOS: Install Xcode command line tools
xcode-select --install

# Linux: Install build essentials
sudo apt install build-essential python3

# Then retry
npm install -g crewly
```

### Cannot Connect to Agent Runtime

```bash
# Verify Claude Code is authenticated
claude --version
claude  # Run once to complete login flow

# Verify Gemini CLI has API key
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should print your key
gemini --version
```

---

## Next Steps

Now that you're up and running:

- **Explore the Dashboard** -- Try all the views: Teams, Projects, Chat, Knowledge, Marketplace
- **Chat with the Orchestrator** -- Use the Chat page to give high-level instructions. The orchestrator will delegate to your agents.
- **Add Knowledge** -- Use the Knowledge page to add docs, SOPs, and architecture notes that agents can reference
- **Install More Skills** -- Browse the marketplace with `crewly search` and install specialized skills
- **Connect Slack** -- Set up the Slack integration for team notifications (see [Configuration](#configuration))
- **Read the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** -- If you want to contribute to Crewly or build custom skills
