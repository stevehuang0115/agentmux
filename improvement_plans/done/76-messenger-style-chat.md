# Task 76: Verify Chat is Messenger-Style Without Conversation History Sidebar

## Priority: Low (May already be complete)

## Problem Statement
User requested that the Chat interface should be messenger-style without a conversation history sidebar on the left.

## Current State (Based on Testing)
The Chat page currently shows:
- "Chat with Orchestrator" title
- "New Chat" header with message count
- Messages displayed in a clean messenger-style format
- Input field at the bottom
- NO conversation history sidebar visible

**Status: This appears to already be implemented correctly.**

## Verification Needed
1. Confirm there is no conversation history sidebar
2. Verify the design matches user expectations for "messenger-style"
3. Check if conversation history is accessible elsewhere (e.g., via a dropdown or separate page)

## Expected Behavior
- Clean, focused chat interface
- No sidebar with past conversations
- Single conversation view at a time
- Possibly a way to start new conversations or access history from a menu (not sidebar)

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to Chat page
2. Verify no sidebar with conversation list is present
3. Verify chat messages display in messenger-style format
4. Confirm input field is at bottom
5. Check if there's an alternative way to access conversation history (if needed)

## Notes
If this is confirmed complete, this task can be moved to the `done/` folder.
