## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Identified from User Testing

### Runtime Errors Blocking Usage âœ… FIXED
- [x] **ESM Import Error** - Fixed 'require is not defined' in tmux service âœ…
- [x] **Session Streaming** - Fixed terminal output not appearing in web UI âœ…  
- [x] **Project Start Workflow** - Fixed team session creation and database sync âœ…

### User Journey Problems âœ… ADDRESSED
- [x] **Team Assignment Flow**: Teams can be assigned to projects (functionality restored) âœ…
- [x] **Task Management Flow**: Users can create and delete tasks with confirmation dialogs âœ…
- [x] **Project File Access**: File tree loading works correctly with proper API responses âœ…
- [x] **Dashboard Experience**: Comprehensive dashboard with project info, stats, and quick actions âœ…
- [x] **Assignment Visibility**: Assignment page shows correct project-team relationships âœ…

ðŸš€ **ENTERING PHASE 9**: Critical runtime issues identified. System needs Claude Code installation guidance and many spec features are missing. Focus on making the system actually usable before adding more features.
