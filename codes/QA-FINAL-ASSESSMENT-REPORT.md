## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (PRODUCTION BLOCKERS)

### 1. Frontend Header Component Mismatch ❌
- **Expected**: "AgentMux" title
- **Actual**: "Select a session and window"
- **Impact**: Branding and navigation broken
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx:88`

### 2. WebSocket Connection Complete Failure ❌
- **Issue**: Zero WebSocket connections established  
- **Evidence**: `socketConnections.length = 0`
- **Impact**: No real-time communication possible
- **File**: Frontend WebSocket integration

### 3. Connection Status Stuck in "Connecting" ❌  
- **Issue**: Status never transitions from "Connecting"
- **Impact**: Users have no system visibility
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx:69-77`

### 4. Session Loading Permanently Stuck ❌
- **Issue**: Sessions never load, permanent loading state
- **Impact**: Core tmux functionality inaccessible
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/SessionPanel.tsx:34-43`

## 🛠 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 🔥 SPRINT 1 - CRITICAL FIXES (THIS WEEK)
**Developer (Window 1) Must Fix:**

1. **Header Component Fix**
   ```typescript
   // Fix line 88 in Header.tsx
   <h1 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">AgentMux</h1>
   ```

2. **WebSocket Connection Setup**
   - Debug Socket.IO client/server configuration

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### For PM (Window 0):
1. **⚠️ REASSESS TIMELINE**: Current issues require 1-2 weeks minimum to resolve
2. **🎯 FOCUS PRIORITIES**: Fix core connectivity before new features
3. **📊 ADJUST EXPECTATIONS**: Phase 1 delivery likely delayed
4. **🔄 DAILY CHECK-INS**: Track critical bug resolution progress

### For Developer (Window 1):
1. **🔧 DEBUG WEBSOCKET**: Priority #1 - Socket.IO configuration
2. **🎨 FIX UI COMPONENTS**: Header and SessionPanel state issues  
3. **⚡ ADD ERROR HANDLING**: Graceful degradation for connection failures
4. **🧪 RUN TESTS LOCALLY**: Before committing any fixes

### For QA Team:
1. **🚫 BLOCK FEATURE TESTING**: Until connectivity works
2. **📋 CREATE REGRESSION SUITE**: For these critical issues
3. **🔄 CONTINUOUS VALIDATION**: Re-test after each fix
4. **📊 WEEKLY QUALITY REPORTS**: Track progress metrics

## 🔍 CONCLUSION

**The AgentMux Frontend has solid architectural foundations but CRITICAL runtime issues that prevent production deployment.**

### Key Insights:
- **Strong Foundation**: Good test infrastructure and component architecture
- **Critical Gap**: Frontend-backend communication completely broken  
- **Immediate Need**: Focus on basic connectivity before new features
- **Timeline Impact**: Phase 1 delivery will be delayed by 1-2 weeks minimum

### Final Recommendation:
**HALT all new feature development until the 4 critical bugs are resolved. Quality is non-negotiable.**

---

**QA Engineer Sign-off**: The frontend is NOT ready for production. Critical issues must be resolved before Phase 1 can proceed.
