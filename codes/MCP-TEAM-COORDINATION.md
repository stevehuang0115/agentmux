# AgentMux MCP Team Coordination

**Project Manager**: Claude (Phase 3 MCP Team Lead)  
**Team Members**: MCP Developer (window 1), MCP QA (window 2)  
**Phase**: 3 (Optional) - MCP Server Preparation  
**Status**: Foundation Complete, Ready for Implementation

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Foundation Work)
- **Architecture Analysis**: Current AgentMux architecture analyzed for MCP integration points
- **MCP Server Design**: Complete MCP server architecture designed (`src/mcp/MCPServer.ts`)
- **Communication Protocols**: Standard Claude-AgentMux interaction patterns defined (`src/mcp/protocols/ClaudeProtocol.ts`)
- **Integration Documentation**: Comprehensive MCP integration guide created (`MCP-INTEGRATION.md`)
- **CLI Entry Point**: Standalone MCP server CLI ready (`src/mcp/cli.ts`)

### ðŸ”„ Current Task: Team Coordination
**MCP Developer (Window 1)** - Begin implementation of MCP server foundation
**MCP QA (Window 2)** - Prepare testing framework for MCP integration

## Team Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup (30 min intervals)
Each team member reports:
1. **Current Focus**: What you're working on right now
2. **Progress**: What you've completed since last update  
3. **Blockers**: Any issues preventing progress
4. **Next Steps**: What you plan to work on next

### Escalation Path
1. **Team Level**: Discuss within tmux session first
2. **Project Manager**: Escalate to Claude if team can't resolve
3. **User Level**: Claude escalates to human if needed

## MCP Developer (Window 1) - Implementation Tasks

### Immediate Tasks (Next 2-4 hours)
1. **Set up MCP SDK Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
   ```

2. **Implement Core MCP Server**
   - Review `src/mcp/MCPServer.ts` foundation
   - Implement missing tool handlers
   - Add error handling and validation
   - Test basic MCP protocol compliance

3. **Integration with AgentMux Core**
   - Ensure FileStorage integration works
   - Verify TmuxManager connectivity  
   - Test ActivityPoller integration
   - Validate data type compatibility

4. **CLI and Transport Layer**

- [ ] Error cases handled gracefully

## MCP QA (Window 2) - Testing Tasks

### Immediate Tasks (Next 2-4 hours)
1. **Set up Testing Environment**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/jest supertest
   ```

2. **Create MCP Test Framework**
   - Mock MCP client for testing
   - Test fixtures for projects/teams/assignments
   - Integration test helpers
   - Performance benchmarking tools

3. **Write Core Test Suites**
   - **Unit Tests**: Individual tool handlers
   - **Integration Tests**: MCP server with AgentMux core
   - **Protocol Tests**: MCP compliance validation
   - **Error Tests**: Edge cases and failure scenarios

4. **Create Test Scenarios**
   - Complete project workflow (create â†’ assign â†’ monitor â†’ complete)
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - Resource exhaustion handling
   - Concurrent operation testing

### Testing Requirements  
- **Coverage**: 90%+ for MCP server code
- **Framework**: Jest with custom MCP testing utilities
- **Integration**: Test against real FileStorage and ActivityPoller
- **Performance**: Response time < 100ms for basic operations
- **Reliability**: All tests pass consistently

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering all MCP tools
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows  
- [ ] Performance tests ensure acceptable response times
- [ ] Error scenarios properly tested and documented
- [ ] Automated test runs in CI/CD pipeline

## Shared Responsibilities

### Documentation
- **MCP Developer**: Update technical documentation as implementation progresses
- **MCP QA**: Document test scenarios and validation procedures
- **Both**: Report any issues or discrepancies in foundation work

### Code Review
- **Peer Review**: All code changes reviewed by other team member
- **Architecture Review**: Any architectural changes reviewed by PM (Claude)
- **Security Review**: Special attention to input validation and error handling

### Integration Points
- **Data Models**: Ensure compatibility with existing AgentMux types
- **API Consistency**: MCP tools should match REST API behavior where applicable
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all tools
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize for acceptable response times

## Current Session Setup

### Window Layout
```
Session: agentmux-mcp-team

Window 0: Project Manager (Claude coordination)
Window 1: MCP Developer (Implementation)  
Window 2: MCP QA (Testing)
```

### Communication Channels
1. **Tmux Session**: Real-time coordination and pair programming
2. **Activity Log**: Progress tracking and milestone documentation
3. **Git Commits**: Code changes with detailed commit messages
4. **Issues/Blockers**: Escalated through PM to user if needed

## Next Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic MCP Server (4-6 hours)
- MCP server responds to all tool calls
- Integration with AgentMux core working
- Basic test suite passing
- CLI entry point functional

### Milestone 2: Full Integration (8-12 hours)  
- All workflow templates working
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization complete
- Documentation updated

### Milestone 3: Production Ready (16-20 hours)
- Error handling robust
- Security validation complete  
- CI/CD integration working
- User acceptance testing passed

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **MCP SDK Compatibility**: New SDK version may have breaking changes
  - *Mitigation*: Pin to specific version, test thoroughly
- **Performance Issues**: MCP calls may be too slow for real-time use
  - *Mitigation*: Profile early, optimize critical paths
- **Integration Complexity**: Existing code may not support MCP patterns
  - *Mitigation*: Minimal changes to core, adapter pattern where needed

### Schedule Risks  
- **Scope Creep**: MCP server functionality could expand beyond Phase 3
  - *Mitigation*: Strict adherence to "foundation only" scope
- **Dependency Issues**: External libraries may cause delays
  - *Mitigation*: Test dependencies early, have fallback plans
- **Resource Conflicts**: Team may need to support Phase 1 issues
  - *Mitigation*: Clear priority: Phase 1 > Phase 3, communicate early

## Success Definition

### Phase 3 Complete When:
1. **MCP Server Foundation**: Complete and tested MCP server implementation
2. **Claude Integration**: Basic Claude Code integration working
3. **Documentation**: Complete integration guide and team protocols  
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 90%+ coverage
5. **Stability**: No critical bugs, graceful error handling
6. **Performance**: Acceptable response times for all operations

### Ready for Phase 4 When:
- Phase 3 success criteria met
- User acceptance testing completed
- Production deployment validated
- Team knowledge transfer complete

## Communication Schedule

### Status Updates
- **Every 30 minutes**: Activity log entry with progress
- **Every 2 hours**: Detailed status in tmux session
- **Daily**: Summary report to PM (Claude)
- **Weekly**: Overall phase progress and risk assessment

### Coordination Points
- **Start of Day**: Review priorities and blockers
- **Mid-Day**: Progress check and resource allocation
- **End of Day**: Wrap-up and next day planning
- **Weekly**: Sprint retrospective and process improvement

## Emergency Procedures

### If Developer Blocked
1. Document blocker in session immediately
2. Attempt team-level resolution for 15 minutes
3. Escalate to PM (Claude) with full context
4. PM provides guidance or escalates to user

### If QA Blocked  
1. Switch to documentation/research tasks
2. Support developer with debugging if possible
3. Escalate through same process if needed
4. Always maintain test coverage goals

### If Both Blocked
1. Immediate escalation to PM (Claude)
2. Full context dump of current state
3. PM takes direct control or escalates to user
4. Clear recovery plan before continuing

This coordination plan ensures our MCP team works efficiently while maintaining high quality standards and clear communication with the overall AgentMux project.
