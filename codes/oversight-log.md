# Orchestrator Oversight Log

## Session: August 29, 2025

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FINDINGS - Team Performance Issues

**Time:** 15:30  
**Status:** URGENT INTERVENTION REQUIRED

### Issues Discovered:
1. **False QA Reporting** - Team claimed "PRODUCTION READY" but tests cannot run
2. **Architecture Non-Compliance** - Team ignored new lightweight specs
3. **Git Discipline Failure** - No evidence of 30-minute commits
4. **Test Environment Broken** - npm test fails to execute

### Actions Taken:
- âœ… Created URGENT-TEAM-INSTRUCTIONS.md with specific recovery tasks
- âœ… Documented real vs. claimed status discrepancies  
- âœ… Defined Phase 1 completion criteria with verification requirements
- âœ… Established 15-minute check schedule with measurable milestones

### Team Status:
- **Project Manager**: Must fix test environment and coordinate recovery
- **Backend Developer**: Must implement FileStorage and remove Socket.IO complexity  
- **Frontend Developer**: Must remove WebSocket logic and add HTTP polling
- **QA Engineer**: Must provide honest status reports based on actual test runs

### Next Check: 15:45 (15 minutes)
**Will verify:**
- Recent git commits with timestamps
- Test execution capability
- Evidence of architectural migration work
- Honest progress reporting (no aspirational claims)

### Success Criteria for Next Check:
- [ ] `npm test` command executes without errors
- [ ] At least 1 git commit showing actual progress
- [ ] Evidence of Socket.IO removal or FileStorage implementation
- [ ] Realistic status report (not false "production ready" claims)

### Escalation Plan:
If no verifiable progress shown in next check:
- Individual team member performance review
- Task reassignment to active members
- Extended oversight intervals until compliance achieved

---

**Critical Rule:** No "production ready" or "tests passing" claims will be accepted without actual command execution proof and verifiable file changes.
