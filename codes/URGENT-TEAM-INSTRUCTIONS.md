# üö® URGENT: Team Instructions - Immediate Action Required

**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**From:** Orchestrator  

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE

Your previous QA report claiming "PRODUCTION READY" status has been **REJECTED** due to verification failures. The following issues must be resolved immediately:

### ‚ùå Problems Identified:
1. **Tests cannot be executed** - npm test fails
2. **False completion claims** - QA report not based on actual test runs
3. **Architecture mismatch** - Still using old complex WebSocket architecture instead of new lightweight specs
4. **Git discipline violations** - No recent commits, team appears idle
5. **Milestone plan ignored** - New lightweight architecture requirements not implemented

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE TASKS (Must Complete Before Next Check)

### üéØ PROJECT MANAGER - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**Priority 1: Fix Test Environment**
```bash
cd /Users/yellowsunhy/Desktop/projects/justslash/agentmux/codes
npm install
npm test
```
- Fix any dependency issues preventing tests from running
- Generate ACTUAL test results, not aspirational reports
- Create test-results.log with real pass/fail status

**Priority 2: Git Discipline Recovery**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Status check: fixing test environment and preparing architecture migration

üö® Previous QA report was incorrect - tests were not actually running
Beginning implementation of lightweight architecture per new specs

Tasks completed:
- Fixed npm dependencies
- Verified actual test status
- Prepared for architecture migration

Next: Begin Phase 1 of lightweight implementation plan"
```

**Priority 3: Team Coordination**
- Verify all team members are active and working
- Assign specific tasks from MILESTONE-PLAN.md
- Report actual status (not aspirational) in 30 minutes

### üîß BACKEND DEVELOPER - CRITICAL TASKS

**Priority 1: Implement Lightweight Architecture (Phase 1)**

1. **Create FileStorage Service**
```typescript
// src/services/FileStorage.ts
import fs from 'fs/promises';
import path from 'path';
import os from 'os';

export class FileStorage {
    private dataPath = path.join(os.homedir(), '.agentmux', 'data.json');
    private activityPath = path.join(os.homedir(), '.agentmux', 'activity.json');

    async loadData(): Promise<AgentMuxData> {
        // Implement JSON file loading with error handling
    }

    async saveData(data: AgentMuxData): Promise<void> {
        // Implement JSON file saving with atomic writes
    }
}
```

2. **Simplify server.ts**
```typescript
// Remove these complex dependencies:
// - Socket.IO
// - JWT authentication middleware  
// - Rate limiting
// - Complex CORS setup

// Replace with simple Express + JSON storage
```

3. **Create Basic REST APIs**
```typescript
// GET/POST /api/projects
// GET/POST /api/teams  
// GET/POST /api/assignments
// GET /api/activity
```

**Commit every 30 minutes with specific progress updates.**

---

### üíª FRONTEND DEVELOPER - CRITICAL TASKS

**Priority 1: Remove Complex Dependencies**

1. **Simplify WebSocket Logic**
```typescript
// Remove: useWebSocket hook complexity
// Remove: Zustand complex state management
// Remove: Authentication components

// Replace with: Simple HTTP polling hook
// Replace with: React Context for state
```

2. **Create Simple Polling Hook**
```typescript
// src/hooks/usePolling.ts
export function usePolling(endpoint: string, interval = 30000) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        const poll = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(endpoint);
                const result = await response.json();
                setData(result);
                setLoading(false);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Polling error:', error);
            }
        };
        
        poll(); // Initial load
        const interval = setInterval(poll, interval);
        return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, [endpoint, interval]);
    
    return { data, loading };
}
```

3. **Update Components**
- Remove WebSocket dependencies
- Add simple status indicators
- Implement basic project/team cards

**Commit every 30 minutes showing actual working code changes.**

### üß™ QA ENGINEER - CRITICAL RECOVERY TASKS

**Priority 1: Fix Test Environment**
```bash
# Fix the broken test setup
npm run test:coverage
./tests/test-runner.sh

# Generate REAL test results
echo "=== ACTUAL TEST RESULTS ===" > test-verification.log
npm test >> test-verification.log 2>&1
```

**Priority 2: Create Honest Status Report**
```markdown
# REAL QA STATUS REPORT

## Test Execution Results:
- [ ] Can run `npm test` without errors
- [ ] API tests: [PASS/FAIL with details]
- [ ] Frontend tests: [PASS/FAIL with details] 
- [ ] Integration tests: [PASS/FAIL with details]

## Architecture Compliance:
- [ ] Removed Socket.IO complexity
- [ ] Implemented JSON file storage
- [ ] Added HTTP polling instead of WebSockets
- [ ] Simplified authentication (local-only)

## Current Blockers:
[List actual issues preventing progress]

## Realistic Timeline:
[Honest assessment of completion timeline]
```

**No more "PRODUCTION READY" claims until tests actually pass.**

---

## üö® GIT DISCIPLINE - MANDATORY FOR ALL

### Every 30 Minutes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Progress: [specific description of what was completed in last 30 minutes]

- [Specific file/function worked on]
- [Specific issue resolved]
- [Next task to work on]

Time: $(date)
Assigned task: [your current milestone task]"
```

### Before Starting Any New Task:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/[task-name]
# Work on feature
git commit -m "Complete: [feature description]"
git tag stable-[feature]-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA (Must Meet Before Next Report)

### Phase 1 Completion Requirements:
- [ ] **Tests actually run**: `npm test` executes without errors
- [ ] **FileStorage implemented**: JSON file operations working
- [ ] **REST APIs created**: Basic CRUD endpoints functional
- [ ] **Frontend simplified**: WebSocket complexity removed
- [ ] **Git discipline**: 30-minute commits resumed
- [ ] **Honest reporting**: No false "production ready" claims

### Verification Process:
1. All code must compile and run
2. Tests must execute (even if some fail initially)
3. Each commit must show measurable progress
4. QA reports must be based on actual test runs
5. No architectural shortcuts - full migration to lightweight specs

---

## üîç Next Oversight Check: 15 Minutes

I will check the following in 15 minutes:
- Recent git commits showing actual progress
- Test execution logs (not claims)
- Evidence of architecture migration work
- Specific files changed with timestamps

**No more aspirational reports. Only verifiable progress will be accepted.**

---

## üìû Emergency Escalation

If any team member is blocked and cannot make progress within 30 minutes:
1. Commit current work immediately
2. Document the specific blocker
3. Request immediate assistance

**The lightweight architecture migration is not optional - it is the core requirement for this project phase.**

*This instruction supersedes all previous assignments. Focus only on these tasks until Phase 1 is verifiably complete.*
