AgentMux: Testing Plan
Version 1.0
Last Updated: August 27, 2025

1. Testing Strategy
   Our testing strategy is focused on ensuring the reliability, functionality, and usability of the AgentMux application. We will employ a multi-layered approach, including unit tests for isolated logic, integration tests for component and service interactions, and end-to-end (E2E) tests for critical user workflows. Given the application's interactive nature, manual usability testing will also be a key component.

2. Types of Testing
   2.1. Unit Testing
   Objective: To verify that individual functions, components, and modules work correctly in isolation.

Tools:

Frontend: Jest & React Testing Library.

Backend: Jest.

Scope:

Frontend:

Test that React components render correctly with given props.

Test UI interactions (e.g., clicking a button calls the correct function).

Test utility functions (e.g., data formatters).

Test Zustand store actions and selectors.

Backend:

Test helper functions (e.g., command builders, parsers).

Test the logic within API route handlers (mocking TmuxService).

Test WebSocket message handling logic.

2.2. Integration Testing
Objective: To test the interaction between different parts of the application.

Tools:

Frontend: React Testing Library (testing components that fetch data from mocked services).

Backend: Jest & Supertest (for API endpoint testing), mock-ws (for WebSocket testing).

Scope:

Frontend: Test that components correctly fetch data from and send data to the tmuxService.

Backend:

Test the full request-response cycle of REST API endpoints, ensuring they interact correctly with the TmuxService and return the expected data.

Test the WebSocket connection handshake and message flow between the client and server logic.

2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
Objective: To simulate real user scenarios from start to finish, ensuring the entire application works as a cohesive whole.

Tools: Cypress.

Scope (Key Test Scenarios):

Scenario 1: Application Launch & View

Run npx agentmux.

Verify the browser opens to the correct URL.

Verify the UI loads and displays a list of currently running tmux sessions.

Scenario 2: Session Creation & Interaction

Click the "New Session" button.

Fill in a session name in the modal and submit.

Verify the new session appears in the sidebar.

Click on the new session's default pane.

Verify the terminal view appears.

Type echo "hello" into the terminal and press Enter.

Verify that "hello" is displayed in the terminal output.

Scenario 3: Window Management

Right-click on an existing session.

Select "New Window" from the context menu.

Verify a new window appears under that session in the sidebar.

Right-click the new window and select "Kill Window."

Verify the window is removed from the sidebar.

2.4. Manual & Usability Testing
Objective: To ensure the application is intuitive, user-friendly, and meets the needs of the target audience.

Scope:

UI/UX Review: Check for visual consistency, clear layout, and intuitive controls.

Responsiveness: Test the application on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure the layout adapts correctly.

Real-World Workflow Testing: Manually perform the common tasks of an AI Orchestrator:

Set up a new project with multiple agents.

Monitor their output simultaneously.

Intervene when an agent gets stuck.

Use the scheduling feature to check on agents.

Performance: Assess the responsiveness of the terminal and the overall UI when many sessions and windows are active.

3. Test Environment
   Operating Systems: Testing will be performed on the latest versions of macOS and a popular Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).

Browsers: Testing will be performed on the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

Dependencies: A clean test environment with node, npm, and tmux installed will be used.

4. Additional Testing Areas

4.1. Performance Testing
Objective: To ensure the application performs well under load.

Test Case: Run the application with 20+ active tmux sessions, each with multiple windows and panes streaming output.

Metrics:

UI Responsiveness: Measure the time for UI updates (e.g., switching panes) using browser performance tools. Must be <200ms.

Memory Usage: Monitor both frontend and backend memory usage to identify potential leaks.

4.2. Security Testing
Objective: To identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

Test Cases:

Attempt to access the server from a different machine on the same network. (Should be blocked by localhost binding).

Attempt to inject shell commands into input fields that create new sessions or windows. (Should be sanitized).

Check that generated scripts have secure permissions.

4.3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Objective: To confirm consistent behavior across supported operating systems.

Test Cases:

Execute all E2E test scenarios on both macOS and Ubuntu.

Verify that the npx setup script correctly identifies the OS and generates compatible shell scripts.
